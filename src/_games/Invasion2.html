<p>
	Invasion 2 introduced a new hand-drawn "death" animation for the stick figures (instead of a fading skull), of which I am still quite proud.
</p>
<p>
	The main gameplay change is the introduction of rams. They have more health, but they are more likely to get hit.
</p>
<p>
	Upgrades no longer increase your speed.
</p>
<p>
	<small>There were, uh, <em>problems</em> with speed in Invasion 1.</small>
