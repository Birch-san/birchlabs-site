<p>
  I started my machine learning journey on an M1 Max. The 64GB of unified memory is useful, but performance and software support are far away from what CUDA offers.
</p>
<p>
  I've spent a lot of time debugging errors in the PyTorch MPS backend, and I try to report these and provide minimal repros as often as I can.<br>In particular I was able to prevent a <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/87010">42x <code>einsum()</code> performance regression</a> from being included in the 1.13.0 release.
</p>
  Frequently I am able to find workarounds (e.g. copying tensors, using different operations, falling back to CPU). The most common problems are with tensor-striding or indexing. Symptoms usually manifest as a black image, or one with a repeating grid pattern.
</p>
<p>
  Backwards pass is a lot harder (issues include NaN loss or autograd crashes), but I got <a href="#textual-inversion">textual inversion</a> working and <a href="#clip-guided-diffusion"><abbr title="Contrastive Languageâ€“Image Pre-training">CLIP</abbr></a> guidance working despite that.
</p>
<p>
  I maintain a <a href="https://github.com/crowsonkb/k-diffusion/compare/master...Birch-san:k-diffusion:mps">fork of k-diffusion</a> with Mac-specific fixes.
</p>
Here are some of the Mac-compatibility bugs I've reported with machine learning libraries/frameworks:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues?q=is%3Aissue+author%3ABirch-san">PyTorch</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/google/jax/issues/11166">JAX</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/openxla/iree/issues?q=is%3Aissue+author%3ABirch-san">IREE</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning/issues/13991">PyTorch Lightning</a></li>
</ul>
