<p>
Made for the <a href="http://armorgames.com/">Armor Games</a> Challenge, this is a comprehensive <abbr>RTS</abbr> made in Flash &mdash; with full AI, troop command and particle effects.
<p>
The game is inspired heavily by Command &amp; Conquer Generals. This explains the "Particle Uplink Cannon" cameo, whose animation is drawn entirely in code.
</p>
<p>This was my most ambitious Flash game. It contains 10,000 lines of code. As the contest deadline approached, we faced a tense release &mdash; and launched just minutes before time ran out (Hawaii time counts, right?).
</p>
<p>Part of the contest reward went to fund the Red Cross, after Hurricane Katrina.
</p>
<p>Voice acting provided by Andy Dennis, and original soundtrack created by my uncle Mark Rainbow.
</p>
<p>
Jamie provided some of the art assets; I believe the Heavy Tank and Helicopter are both traced from military blueprints.
</p>
<p>Inglor (of Armor Games) asked if I would be up for building a sequel. My first thought was to add flamethrower troopers and flame tanks. Sadly I found that the Flash Player produced&hellip; undefined behaviour (e.g. sprites flickering) once I added any further code.</p>
