	Experiment in Flash sprite handling; avoids fractional coordinates to prevent blurring. Attacks have differing priorities, and use this as a basis for clashes. Certain attacks can be chained into combos. Simple gravity physics is provided, and even acknowledged by the AI (who solves quadratic equations to work out how far he can jump, and if a platform can be used as part of their route-finding). You can use Naruto's signature "shadow clone technique" to create AI allies!

Player 1 uses WASD to move, T and Y to attack. T attack requires charged chakra.<br/>
