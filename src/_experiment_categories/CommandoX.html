<p>Here's a little experiment that spews out infantry created from the aforementioned spritesheet. It was originally an attempt at making a Commando 4, but trying to keep the engine fast made it very hard to work on. By the way, it's only called Commando X because Commando 4 was already taken, and I didn't want to skip to Commando 5 because it'd be confusing if I ever released it.</p>
