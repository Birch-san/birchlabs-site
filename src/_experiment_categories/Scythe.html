<p>This takes me back. Scythe was a game that Kortex wanted to make, in the style of 'Soulmech Shinobu'. A to use slash-combo, S to eat fallen souls for magic, and D to throw fireballs. Arrow keys to move and jump. I think this game came out pretty well, but we left it at level 1 it due to lack of interest.</p>
