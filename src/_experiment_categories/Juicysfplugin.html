<p>Juicysfplugin is a macOS audio plugin (VST/AU) for playing MIDI music through a soundfont synthesizer.</p>
<p>It's well-suited for making videogame music. If you have a soundfont of your favourite game, you can write your own melodies with its instruments.</p>
<p>Built using <a href="https://github.com/WeAreROLI/JUCE">JUCE</a> framework. <a href="http://www.fluidsynth.org/">Fluidsynth</a> is the soundfont synthesizer.</p>
<p>This was my first C++ program. The backend runs in Fluidsynth, so mainly this was an exercise in builing a front-end, and correctly linking dependencies.</p>
