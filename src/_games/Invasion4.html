<p>
	Invasion 4 aimed to address the balance issues of the previous games (i.e. that it was moreorless impossible to lose).
</p>
<p>
	I believe the idea was:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Prefer upgrading troops, rather than just buying more
		<ul>
			<li>(This was <em>actually</em> to reduce the number of objects on-screen; Mac Flash Player could only handle ~100 at the time)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Never spend <em>all</em> your money.</li>
	<li>Try out the other unit types</li>
</ul>
<p>
	KorteX drew up some new environment art, which helped distract people from the fact that every level is actually the same except with two numbers increased.
</p>
<p>The launch was a complete failure; we went live without ever checking that the game could load over a network. Essentially the preloader didn't work, but running it from disk never revealed this.</p>
<p>
	<small>Apparently there was a high score table at some point? I guess I took it down after it became super-obvious that only hackers used it.</small>
