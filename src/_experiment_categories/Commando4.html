<p>The main problem I saw with Commando 3 (besides the appalling engine) was that the graphics were too intensive to allow any major battles to run well. So I turned to one of the (now old) versions of the Invasion 5 engine for a speed boost. However, it turned out that making a side-on RTS was a stupid, inflexible idea. Sprite work was far too fiddly, and bugs were impossible to catch, with the result being that I abandoned the project. Kortex did the artwork for this prototype, and I feel bad about these animations never seeing the light of day. If I do ever try to make a Commando 4 again, it'll be a top-down RTS for sure, probably with buildings, and it'd use the Invasion 5 sprite engine. If anyone's wondering why I've been so reluctant to embark on such a project, look at the spritesheet linked below... I made that by hand; no code involved. THAT is how many sprites need to be prepared for ONE unit in a top-down game (and of course I need to do it a second time for team two :P). It's not fun at all. And it only works with small units; a sprite sheet for the tank (actually note that I'd need TWO spritesheets - one for the turret, one for the base) would be too big to fit within Flash's 2880x2880 bitmap size limit. It could be spread between several bitmaps, but this is a real pain to do. I also had an explanation of the collision system used in Commando 4 (a derivation of the one used in Invasion 5) lying around, so I've attached that as well.</p>
