<p>I set out trying to write a mode7 engine to allow me to use 3D worlds in my games. However, clear documentation was hard to come by, so instead, I opted for something even harder - a fully-fledged polygon-based 3D engine. After weeks of hard work (this was perhaps the most complicated coding I'd done at that point), I got a decent prototype going. I came to the sad conclusion that this engine was not fast enough to be used to display a 3D landscape (or rather, I had to make a compromise between speed and clarity - if I were to cut the picture into only two triangles, it'd run very fast, but the 3D transformation would be pretty unimpressive). Also would need to implement backface culling to make any meaningful 3D geometry. However, I'm very proud of what I accomplished. The image used in it is a Megatokyo strip.</p>
