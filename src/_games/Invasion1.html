	<a href="http://www.xgenstudios.com/">XGen Studios</a> had a fun game called Defend Your Castle. I wondered one Hallowe'en what it would be like to play <em>against</em> the castle. Invasion was born!
</p>
<p>
	My original intention had been to make minor in-place updates to Invasion 1, but on portals like Newgrounds you get more traffic if you release anew.
</p>
<p>
	This is why there are mysterious greyed-out units in Invasion 1. The idea was: "Invasion is unfinished; wait for the update".
</p>
<p>
	<small>For 8 years I received emails from people trying to "unlock" those units.</small>
