<p>A hugely important part of Orbit was the gravity engine. Using  complicated vector maths (at the time this was beyond what I'd encountered in school), I was able to make the man stay perpendicular to all vectors (a pseudo-gravitational effect). After this I developed a more 'real' interpretation of gravity (with inverse square pull from each node), enhancing it with the previous engine's ability to handle 'lines' of gravity rather than simple points.</p>
