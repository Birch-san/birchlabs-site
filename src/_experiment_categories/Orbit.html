<p>This was a response to Nintendo's game, Super Mario Galaxy. I wanted to see if I could write a platform engine that was independent of orientation (that is to say, you could walk forward all the way around the surface of a planetoid, sticking to the surface the whole time). While my engine handled the gravity simulation perfectly, collision handling was another matter - the levels were to be bitmaps (actually photos I'd taken as part of my Art course - you can see them in this site's Gallery), so instead of using maths-based collision, it had to be an algorithm that was accurate to a fraction of a pixel. The engine had problems traversing certain types of terrain (believe me when I say I tried to fix this), and ultimately had to be abandoned for this reason. Oh, and the reason that the 'hero' character is the Saboteur from Invasion is because it was the first thing I found.</p>
<p>I ported it to ActionScript 3.0, since I was planning to make some VAST levels, and all the speed I could squeeze out of the Flash Player was welcome. Here are the two versions of the game (the AS3 one has planet-hopping in it, although it's not very well implemented):</p>
