<h1>Birchlabs.co.uk</h1>
<h2><small>Purpose</small></h2>
<p>Birchlabs presents the hobby projects of Alex and Jamie Birch.</p>
<p>Mostly these include the Flash games that we built during our childhood.
We also make:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Drawings</li>
  <li>Tech experiments</li>
  <li>Blog posts</li>
  <li>Music</li>
</ul>
<h2><small>Original website</small></h2>
<p>The original <a href="index_flash.html">snazzy Flash website</a> still exists.</p>
<p>We have switched the front page to plain-text, because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>This plain webpage is more useful to mobile devices</li>
  <li>Content can be found better by search engines</li>
  <li>Flash is dead ðŸ˜ž</li>
</ul>
