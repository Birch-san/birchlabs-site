	Now this was an interesting experiment. I was trying to capture the grid-tearing effect used in the Geometry Wars games, for the Polygon project. I don't know the maths involved in doing this with the position data of actual grid nodes, but I figured I could make a pretty neat imitation of the effect using the DisplacementMapFilter - this is a filter that shuffles pixels into different positions based on a reference bitmap (it's only hard to explain because I don't understand it :P). It came out really well, and I managed to find a few really clever ways to speed up the effect. Sadly, I've never used it.
