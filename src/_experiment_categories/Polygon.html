<p>With the incredibly fast rendering and collision detection methods from Invasion 5, I decided to see if I could create a Geometry Wars clone (the problem with existing Flash Geometry Wars games is that they don't run fast enough to push around the number of sprites that the original game did). Turns out I could, I just couldn't be bothered to finish it. One good thing that came from this project was that I wrote a spritesheet generator, which might just solve the aforementioned sprite problems involved with making a fourth Commando game. Three versions here - one is of the neat eyecandy you get when you fade the battlefield bitmap every frame instead of clearing it, the next is an example of what the game would look like with the colour scheme I intended, and finally an example with a moving enemy and a modified colour scheme so that the cool ripple effect I wrote is visible.</p>
<p>
  <small>This experiment requires a real Flash Player; our current <a href="https://ruffle.rs/">Ruffle</a> build doesn't support AS3 fully.</small>
