<p>The Box was starting to feel its age, so I decided to have a go at revamping it using the skills I've acquired since I made the last version. Changes included upping the framerate, making the shrink items work (hah!), fixing the enemy's rotation easing, redrawing the player as a square (never realised he was a rectangle), easing the player's movement, adding a sensible speed cap, fixing item spawning and mapping the controls to the WiiMote (that's right, it'll be compatible with the Wii if I ever put it on WiiCade). I actually left this only a few lines away from completed, but it's a simple enough game that I wasn't invested.</p>
