	In the early days of Flash, there were very few games resembling real-time strategy.
</p>
<p>
	I suspect it's because the <abbr title="real-time strategy">RTS</abbr> genre forces you to tackle the problem of "pathfinding" at some point; I designed Commando to require no collision avoidance, nor obstacles.
</p>
<p>
	The first Commando game has no controls; it is just a battle simulator. I actually think this is an interesting take on <abbr>RTS</abbr> combat. <a href="http://www.slitherine.com/games/legion_gold" rel="nofollow">Legion</a> is the only game I've seen like it.
