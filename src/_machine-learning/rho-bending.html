<p>
  When <a href="#diffusion-sampling-in-4-steps">few-step sampling</a>, you may find that your image is moreorless good, but has some errors in fine detail or composition.
</p>
<p>
  You can change the <code>rho</code> parameter of a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00364">Karras schedule</a> to bend the denoising schedule to allocate more sigmas to the highly-noised or lightly-noised part of the schedule.
</p>
<p>
  <code>rho</code> is typically 7, but decreasing it (e.g. to 5) will sample more from high sigmas (>2), expending more effort on high-level composition.<br>
  Conversely: increasing it (e.g. to 10) will sample more from low sigmas (<1), expending more effort on fine detail.
